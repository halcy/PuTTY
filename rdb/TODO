For UTF8 Update

    Pull 'compatibility' updates out into own patch

    Should lookahead buffer be a bag (self expanding) ?

    MBCS addition: take note that wchar_t is UTF16 on Windows. ****! ****! ****!
	Fix mb_to_wc ?

    Other codepages configured from host ?

    wcwidth() is now commonly in the C library (POSIX 2001), this version
    should be used as the internal one is probably out of date.
    (Windows, of course, is not compatible)

UTF8 Fonts

    It would appear that there will remain very few fonts that covert the
    entire unicode range. PuTTY should allow a more general method for
    selecting fonts for various ranges.

    The best method for specifing these ranges is not clear.

Colours

    XTerm has added a 'truecolor' mode; but it translates to 256 colours.
    But I want to do more.

    LRU on 240 extra colours in numbers 263..510 ?
	-- When LRU starts replacing colours they will change.

    Konsole has full 24bit colour support.

    Or could use combining characters to add a colour fixer character. (Hack?)

    Current colours are 9bit, 262 colours.
    Could add 33bits to extend this to two 25bit values and an extend flag.
	Breakout bitattr, fgcolour, bgcolour in term structure.
	-- 3*the current attribute size!
	    ? Okay for display array?
		15000 cells * 3 screens (buffer, alternate, display)

	    Current cell is 3 ints. (long,long,int)
	    New cell 5 ints.	    (chr,attr,bg,fg,cc_next)
	    Include bitfield compile option
		currently:  bitattr:9, bg:9, fg:9

	    => Old = 540,000 bytes.
	    => New = 900,000 bytes.

	Merge this down to 60bits for display array.
	-- 2*the current attribute size ?
	    -- 2nd element can contain colour extension bits only.

	    9bits for current flags.
	    1bit for scrollback compression.
	    fg:
		1bit for palette vs tc
		9bit for palette (or 9bit for 888 colour)
	    bg:
		1bit for palette vs tc
		9bit for palette (or 9bit for 888 colour)

	    = 30 bits.
	    15bit for each colour in extension word.
	    = 30 bits

		? Colour extension word in a combining character ?
		    -- Better scollback compression if real field.

	Reconfigure the scrollback compressor.
	-- Same as current size ?

    Official way would be to extend termchar by an extra 48 bits ... bit big.
	Has both 24bit and closest 8bit.
	-- Both not needed; can *ask* BE if truecolour is acceptable.
	-- Convert colours to needed format when received.

    SHOULD look for matching palette colour in 16..256 as these cannot change
    and will shrink the data.

    How to pass to Windows backend ?
    Decode the colours in terminal.c ?

Portable PuTTY

    Give the Windows version a "-load" flag to load a Unix session file.
	-- Problem SSH host keys.
	-? Only one needed per remote, add to session file ?
	-? Conflict between session host key and system ? Timestamp?

Use TCL for the dialog box.

    Makes the configuration an external app, PuTTY keeps running naturally.
    Needs IPC to prod putty to reload 'Current Config'.
	Process termination and file modification time ?

    Get expanding boxes, nice scripting etc etc.
    Easy, for more people, to modify.
    Can have 'start and stay open' for config box (AKA real apply button).
    Dumb replacements too "pterm -e vi $HOME/.putty/tmp/Config.1234"

Dynamic Attributes

    Some attributes don't need interpretation in the display driver as they
    don't have a unique display 'footprint'. These attributes could be stored
    only in the current state in the term structure.

    ATTR_BLINK		    Just redraw
    ATTR_BLINK As BRIGHT    Use different colours
    ATTR_REVERSE	    Swap the colours
    ATTR_SELECTION	    Swap the colours again
    ATTR_DIM		    Use different colours
    ATTR_CONCEAL	    Use different colours
    ATTR_BGBOLD             Use different colours

    Some of these would still need representation in the display array
    in terminal.c, for example ATTR_BLINK needs to get translated to a
    physical representation on the fly for 'Blink On' and 'Blink Off'.

    Does this mean we want a new ATTR_* set just for terminal.[ch] ?

    Physical attributes:
	ATTR_FGCOLOUR
	ATTR_BGCOLOUR
	ATTR_BOLD
	ATTR_ULINE

    Semi-physical
	ATTR_REVERSE/SELECTION
	ATTR_CONCEAL
	ATTR_BLINK
